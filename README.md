### Zoho Deluge Projects

This is a Temperature Taking form created using [Zoho Deluge](https://www.zoho.com/deluge/), which is Zoho's proprietary scripting language.
- The form is also integrated into Zoho Cliq (Zoho's online messaging platform) which allows for alert messages to be sent to managers when an employee records a temperature of 37.5 degrees celsius.

This is also a Custom Chat project (custom bot commands) Zoho Cliq (similar to the Telegram Bot API project, but using Zoho Deluge).
- The Zoho Cliq custom slash commands can send documents to a user, as well as fetches a response from a user and sends to a specific Zoho Cliq channel.
